I've just started reading Ernest W. Watson's [Creative Perspective for Artists and Illustrators](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Perspective-Artists-Illustrators-Instruction/dp/0486273377) and I found that it cleared up several confusions I had about how perspective works, why correct perspective can seem distorted, and when and in what way you might want to bend the rules.

I'll follow Watson's convention and refer to the standard rules of perspective as *scientific perspective*.

## What is perspective?

Stand in front of a window, and (keeping your head still and closing one eye) use a marker to trace what you see on the window. Then the resulting 2-dimensional picture will be in correct perspective. That is, we imagine a "picture plane" (the window) floating in front of us, and project our vision onto this plane by intersecting the light rays from an object to our eyes with the plane. This is also the same perspective as that created by an idealised camera.

The window idea shows us the precise sense in which scientific perspective is "correct" -- if you replace the window with a really good perspective painting, keep your head in exactly the same place and keep one eye closed, you won't be able to tell the difference.

But we often want to show dramatic perspective without painting on a wall-sized canvas and insisting that it must be viewed from no further than a metre away! A small print or an image on a computer screen is never going to fill your field of vision. And in this scenario it's less clear whether whether scientific perspective is best.

## Perspective distortion

Human vision is very different from a camera. We see very little detail away from the centre of our vision, and so our eyes constantly dart about while our brain fools us into thinking we have a sharp image of our whole field of vision. Also our internal experience is more like viewing an image on a hemisphere than on a flat screen. In particular angles do not appear to change if you move your eyes while keeping your head still, whereas the angles measured on a camera image change as you rotate the camera.

This is why extreme perspective can appear distorted. For example in the below diagram of a rectangle in perspective, the near corner makes an acute angle, while we always perceive the near corner of a rectangle to make an obtuse angle.

Of course if you displayed the diagram on a very large screen and stood in the right spot very close to it then the near corner of the rectangle would appear obtuse from your point of view, and so look correct. But when viewed normally its the angle as measured on the screen that matters, and this angle doesn't match your experience of rectangles.

That is not to say that this image is *wrong*, though. It's impossible to perfectly match the experience of dramatic perspective in a small image, just as it's impossible to make a flat map that accurately represents the surface of the Earth! And scientific perspective matches the appearance of a photo - in fact Watson says "Although it is an 'unnatural' effect, we have become so accustomed to such photographic exaggerations that they are more readily accepted than formerly".

## Creative perspective

What this does mean is that you should feel free to stray from the rigid rules of scientific perspective in circumstances where it doesn't give the effect that you desire, even if you're aiming for realism.

This image from an Association of American Railroads advertisement by Fred Chance is one of Watson's examples. All the railway sleepers are parallel and perpendicular to the viewer, so in usual perspective they should all be perfectly horizontal. But in the picture we see the sleepers on the left are converging towards a vanishing point to the left, and the sleepers on the right are converging towards a vanishing point to the right. This is arguably a better representation of what a person would see, while a distorted appearance at the corners might distract from the central focal point.
